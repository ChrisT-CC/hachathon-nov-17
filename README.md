# [SoundsGood](deployed link)


# Description

SoundsGood is a music game that uses musical notes to:
  1. Learn the sound and name of a musical note
  2. Test their memory skills by having them rekey a range of music samples
  3. Make their own music using the virtual keyboard

The app is intended primarily as entertainment but might also be considered edutainment.
